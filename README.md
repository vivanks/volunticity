<b> Algorithm </b>


Finding prospective organizations for potential volunteers is a very tedious task when done manually and requires significant human resources in the operations team.

An algorithhm was made to automate this process. The data is stored in Google Sheets considering the assuarance of security. Subsequently, the algorithm is written in form of Google Apps Script

The script runs in the background which matches the organizations and volunteers based on their domains of interest and available hours of work.
